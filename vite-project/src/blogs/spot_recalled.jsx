    <p>
        Every year, companies recall thousands of products because they are unsafe, faulty, or mislabeled. 
        These products can harm you, your family, or even your pets, but many people still have them sitting 
        in their homes without knowing. Here’s how you can check and spot a recalled product before it causes problems.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2><strong>Check the News and Official Websites</strong></h2>

            <p>
                Government agencies and consumer safety websites regularly publish lists of recalled products.
                For example, in the U.S., you can check the 
                <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov" target="_blank">Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</a> 
                website, and in Nigeria, check NAFDAC updates for recalled food and drugs. 
                These lists often include product names, batch numbers, and images.

            <h2><strong>Look for Expiry Dates and Batch Numbers</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Most recalled products can be identified by their batch/lot numbers or expiry dates. 
                These are usually printed on the packaging, label, or bottom of the product. 
                Compare these with the details from official recall announcements.
            </p>
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <h2><strong>Watch for Unusual Smells, Colors, or Textures</strong></h2>

            <p>
                Some recalled food and cosmetic products show visible signs of damage or contamination, 
                like a strange smell, change in color, mold, or unusual texture. 
                If it looks or smells “off,” stop using it immediately and verify if it’s been recalled.
            </p>
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <h2><strong>Use the Recall King App</strong></h2>

            <p>
                Instead of searching through multiple websites, the Recall King app alerts you instantly if a 
                product you own has been recalled. Simply enter the product name, scan the barcode, 
                or browse categories to check. It saves time, keeps you updated, 
                and helps you remove risky products before they cause harm.
            </p>
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <h2><strong>Listen to Manufacturer Announcements</strong></h2>

            <p>
                Sometimes recalls are announced directly by the company through social media, text messages, 
                or store notices. If you registered your product after purchase (like electronics, baby gear, 
                or appliances), you’re more likely to get these alerts.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
<br>
    <p><strong>✅ Tip:</strong> If you find a recalled product, stop using it immediately, follow the instructions for return or disposal, and never try to “fix” it yourself.</p>

    <br>

    <p><strong>⚠ Remember:</strong> A recall doesn’t always mean the product is completely bad, it means there’s a risk, and companies are acting to keep you safe.</p>
