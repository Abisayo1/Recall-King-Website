    <p>In today’s competitive marketplace, customer loyalty is more valuable than ever. With so many options available, consumers are quick to switch brands when they feel neglected or unsafe. One of the clearest opportunities for a brand to prove its integrity is in how it responds to a <b>product recall</b>.</p><br>

    <p>While recalls are often seen as a setback, they can actually become a <b>powerful trust-building moment</b>. Brands that act swiftly, communicate clearly, and put consumer safety first often come out stronger, earning loyalty that lasts long after the crisis has passed.</p><br>

    <h2><strong>Here’s why brands that act fast on recalls win over their customers</strong></h2><br>
